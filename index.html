        <h3> READING!!!ðŸ˜€</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>Reading is the #1 of the many things I love to do. During this summer reading was the thign that made summer exiting. I loved deafting Lord Voldemort with Harry potter and swimming by the side for the semi-mermaid, Emily Windsnap. Every free time I have, I pull out a book and devour it. I am book monster and books are always on my menu! </p>
